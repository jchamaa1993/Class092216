	<p>	My full name is Judd Nader Chamaa. I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on March 30, 1993 to two immigrant parents from Syria. I moved to Orange County, California at the age of six with my two parents and younger brother, and have called it my home ever since. I received my B.S. in Civil Engineering and my M.S. in Structural Earthquake Engineering from the University of California Los Angeles in 2015 and 2016, respectively. I now reside in Marina Del Rey and work for DPR, a general contractor, as a Project Engineer.</p>
	<br>
	<p>My hobbies include sports, coding, and hanging out with friends. My favorite activity is playing basketball. </p>
